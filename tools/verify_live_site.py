"""Fail when the site GitHub Pages serves is not the site this checkout builds.

pages.yml renders the site from the harness on every push to main and uploads
it. The render is pure: `gauntlet site` reads the built-in suites and action.yml
and nothing else, so the same commit gives byte-identical pages. What has never
been checked is whether the pages a reader receives are that render. A pages run
that failed, never fired, or published an older commit would leave ci.yml green
while the published gate inventory described a different set of gates, and
nothing in this repository could tell.

This is the check for the deployment. It reads the deploy's own generated-on
date off the live page, rebuilds the whole site from the checkout stamped with
that date, and fails naming every byte-level difference.

    uv run python tools/verify_live_site.py

The date is the single thing a rebuild cannot reproduce, because the deploy
stamps the day it ran. Reading it from the live page rather than guessing it
keeps every other byte under exact comparison, and the date itself is bounded
rather than trusted: it must parse, it must not be in the future, and it must
not predate the commit this check ran against, which is the case where the
deployment is older than the code.

Vacuity is the failure mode a check like this is most exposed to, so four
things are refused outright instead of being reported as a pass:

  * a rebuild that produces fewer files than the floor, because a sentinel that
    compares nothing and prints OK is worse than no sentinel at all;
  * any fetch that does not return HTTP 200, an unreachable host included;
  * an origin that answers a guaranteed-missing path with anything but 404,
    which is how a catch-all would make every matching comparison meaningless;
  * a live page with no generated-on line to read a date from, since rebuilding
    against a date nobody published would be comparing this checkout to itself.

Exit codes: 0 the live surface is the published surface, 1 it is not, 4 the
check could not run.
